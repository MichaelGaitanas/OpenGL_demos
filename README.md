# OpenGL_demos

This project contains some examples-tutorials-demos of OpenGL. The codes are written in C++.

In order to follow the examples, it is essential that you know C++. We recommend this website [https://www.learncpp.com].
OpenGL tutorials can be found in this website [https://learnopengl.com].

In order to be able to run all the example codes, the following dependencies must be installed :
1) C++ compiler. We use GNU's gcc (g++).
2) OpenGL kernel. This is usually preinstalled in all operating systems.
3) GLFW. This provides hardware functionality (keyboard, mouse, monitor, Xbox controller, etc...).
4) GLEW. This is complicated... We need GLEW because OpenGL function pointers, especially for modern features, aren't loaded automatically by the system. GLEW
   dynamically loads these functions at runtime, allowing your application to use modern OpenGL across different hardware and drivers.
5) GLM. Fast algebra-geometry functions needed for spatial rendering and transformations (dot product, cross product, matrix multiplication, etc...).

In case we want to add GUI rendering and plots (see below), ImGui and ImPlot must be installed as well. Here, the corresponding libraries are already present
in the /imgui directory. Originally obtained via : [https://github.com/ocornut/imgui] and [https://github.com/epezent/implot].

In case you use g++ compiler, here's how you can compile and run the .cpp programs in the /examples directory :

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Windows :

Assuming that the example does NOT use ImGui/ImPlot stuff :

In cmd : g++ example.cpp -o example.exe -lopengl32 -lglfw3 -lglew32

Assuming that the example uses ImGui/ImPlot stuff :

In cmd : g++ example.cpp -o example.exe (PATH_TO_OPENGL_DEMOS)\imgui\*.cpp -I (PATH_TO_OPENGL_DEMOS)\imgui -lopengl32 -lglfw3 -lglew32

It is a good idea to (pre)compile it as a static library, so that you don't have to compile every time the same code.

Compile as a static library : Navigate to the imgui folder and then, in the cmd write :
a) g++ -c *.cpp
b) ar rcs libimgui.a *o
Library is created.
Then, for every new code : g++ example.cpp -o example.exe -L (PATH_TO_OPENGL_DEMOS)\imgui -limgui -lopengl32 -lglfw3 -lglew32

Linux :

Assuming that the example does NOT use ImGui/ImPlot stuff :

g++ example.cpp -o example -lGL -lglfw -lGLEW

Assuming that the example uses ImGui/ImPlot stuff :

In cmd : g++ example.cpp -o example (PATH_TO_OPENGL_DEMOS)/imgui/*.cpp -I (PATH_TO_OPENGL_DEMOS)/imgui -lGL -lglfw -lGLEW

The steps for precompiling ImGui/ImPlot, are the same with the Windows steps.

Then, for every new code : g++ example.cpp -o example -L (PATH_TO_OPENGL_DEMOS)/imgui -limgui -lGL -lglfw -lGLEW
