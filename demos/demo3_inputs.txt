Notes :

1)  The obj shape must be a manifold geometry. The higher the resolution (triangles), the higher the computational cost.
2)  The light longitude must range in [0, 360).
3)  The light latitude must range in [0, 180].
4)  The shadow resolution must be a positive integer, preferably a power of 2 (e.g. 2^9 = 512, 2^10 = 1024, etc...). The higher the value, the higher the computational cost.
5)  The camera sensor size (width and height) must be positive integers. The higher the values, the higher the computational cost.
6)  The camera (vertical) field of view (fov) must be a positive real number in [1, 175]. Avoid the limits because they result in a very distorted view.
7)  The camera distance from the target must be set, such that it is located outside the target's surface for obvious reasons... The Brillouin sphere is used as a metric to display a warning to the user if they place the camera inside.
8)  The camera longitude must range in [0, 360).
9)  The camera latitude must range in [0, 180].
10) The asteroid rotation axis is constant and must be either 1, 2 or 3, corresponding to rotation around either x, y or z.
11) The asteroid angular velocity must be a real number.
12) The simulated duration must be a positive real number.
13) The simulated step must be a positive real number.
