           visible in the second rendering pass because the quad’s texture is the rendered scene itself. The quad essentially acts as a
           canvas for displaying the pre-rendered scene. Since the quad covers the entire screen and the texture it uses
           is the complete scene, it looks like we are rendering the scene again, but really we are just displaying the
           result of the first pass. We do this to apply apply the blur effect. But why not directly in the "texture.frag" shader? Why
           do we write another shader? Well, because the first fragment shader only deals with local information related to the mesh.
           For a blur effect (or other effects), we need to operate on scene as whole image, because we have to take into account
           neighboring pixels everywhere in the renered scene. The classical fragment shader of a mesh doesn't have access to
           information about other pixels outside the mesh that is drawing. Even though one could perhaps modify the fragment shader of
           a mesh in a way that a blur (or other) effect is achieved, it is not recommended. What if you have 4 different fragment shaders
           in your rendered scene? Would you alter all 4 shaders (much code, poor performance)? What about the seperating scene regions
           where one mesh gets in front of another (those regions will not be blurred)? However operating on the scene as an image-globally,
           yields global scene effects, which is the desired. Enough for a code comment...
