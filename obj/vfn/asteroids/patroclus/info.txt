Currently they are unknown, so we model them as triaxial ellipsoids with their semi-axes values obtained from occultation observations.

Patroclus (primary) semi-axes :
a1 = 63.5 [km]
b1 = 58.5 [km]
c1 = 49.0 [km]

Menoetius (secondary) semi-axes :
a2 = 58.5 [km]
b2 = 54.0 [km]
c2 = 45.0 [km]

Mutual separation :
r = 664.6 [km] (Assuming equilibrium state, i.e. circular orbits and tidal locking.)

Orbital period :
T = 4.41 [days]

Mass density :
œÅ = 881 [kg/m^3]

Binary total mass (Observed and then Keplerian fit probably...) :
Mtot,obs = M1 + M2 = 1.36*10^18 [kg]

Binary total mass (This is evaluated by me via 2nd order mutual potential fit ) :
Mtot,eval = M1 + M2 = 1.19264*10^18 [kg]
M1 = 0.669656*10^18 [kg]
M2 = 0.522984*10^18 [kg]
